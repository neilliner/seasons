### StoryA :

##### Reality -- seasons changing

* It's day time during winter. Iceburg floating on the sea. It's snowing and wind blowing. The iceburgs are in white and light blue.
* The season is changing to spring. The snow stop. The water color changing from blue to green. The sky is getting clear and shiny. The iceburgs turn cristal blue. Fishes are jumping out of the water.

##### Abstract -- still scene
* The iceburgs turn into gems that have all kinds of color like emerald, ruby and sapphire.
* The sea dissapeared so the gem looks like floating in a dark space.
* There is aurora going around in the space.

##### Interactivities:
* MouseX = 0 : winter; MouseX = width : spring; 
* Press x : shift between reality and abstract.
* Mouse-clicked : generate a new iceburg/gem.
* Mouse-drag : Changing the dynamic direction of snow/aurora.

##### Animation and transition:
* Snowing speed from fast to slow and gradually stop.
* Sun is shining above the horizon. ( [reference in Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/530017449872340183/) ).
* Fish are jumping out of the water randomly. (fish shape can be as simple as a line).

##### Iceburgs and Waves
* Iceburgs are floating and impacted by the waves.

* Mouse-clicked -- generate a new iceburg.
* Mouse-over -- repell the iceburg.
* Music ....

##### Trees
* Mouse-clicked -- Plant a tree.
* Mouse-over -- Trees grow up.

##### The big idea / The concept

What are seasons?
* Seasons are the passing of time.
* Seasons are dictated by time and without time seasons canâ€™t exist.

Everything is temporary. Everything in life are at the mercy of time.

##### Story
* Give something life and when time moves forward seasons pass and this thing eventually dies. 
* The things can be particles that are born and dies off as seasons pass.
