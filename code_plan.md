# Code Plan
## Electric Sun

### Elements
* Sun
* Stars
* Cloud
* Lightning Bolt

### Plan
* play music
* analize frequencies
* draw sun 
* calculate avarage frequency
* use average frequency to draw gradient black -> red 
* visualize all frequencies as sun ray
* when drum starts, rotate sun ray
* if freq 1 - 360 rotate clockwise
* if freq 361 - 720 rotate counter clockwise
* if freq 721 - 1024 rotate clockwise but faster
* if average freq greater than 120 display lightning bolt

* stars appear and moving and disappear and appear again
* cloud appears several layers
* if less than 10, make new layer (for top and bottom of screen)
* visualize sun flare as waveform
* rotate waveform to appear randomly from center 
* after descend and ascend again, change environment
